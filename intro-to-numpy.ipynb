To do this, it uses a strategy called broadcasting. You can read more about broadcasting on [its NumPy documentation page](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html), but here's the basic idea. Supposing you perform some operation like `a + b`, then:\n\n1. If the shapes of `a` and `b` are equal, then `a + b` is calculated element-wise over each pair of matched cells.\n2. If `a` has more axes than `b` (i.e., `len(a.shape) > len(b.shape)`), then it attempts to run `a[i] + b` for every slice along the first axis. So if you add a vector to a matrix, NumPy will add that vector to each row of the matrix. (This rule works the same way if `b` has more axes than `a` but in reverse.)\n3. If `a` and `b` have the same number of axes and their shapes are not equal, BUT the only differences in their shapes occur where one of the arrays has an axis of size equal to 1, then the array with the axes of size 1 are essentially expanded along to match the other array's axis.

Python's loops are slow because Python is a high-level language, and the amount of work it has to do for every iteration of a loop to keep track of changes in the runtime system is very high. Low-level languages like C, the language in which Python and modules like NumPy were written, can perform loops very efficiently. Accordingly, if you can write code that forces NumPy to perform your loop operations, your speed can be significantly improved.\n\nTo demonstrate this, let's think about an example problem. Suppose we had a dataset consisting of a collection of temperature measurements at a set of points in 3D space and we need to calculate the average temperature of the measurements on each side of a screen at the plane `x = 0`. We'll simulate the problem for 1,000,000 points that we randomly draw from a normal distribution over each dimension, and we'll randomly draw temperatures from a normal distribution as well.","metadata":{}},{"id":"5868dd3b-1d17-47e0-8fc7-5aaaab1af6d6","cell_type":"code","source":"n = 1000000\nmeasurement_points = np.random.randn(n, 3)\nmeasurement_temps = np.random.randn(n) * 4 + 15","metadata":{"trusted":false},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"id":"f383742d-ce82-4b1f-bc88-31ff105ec771","cell_type":"markdown","source":"A naive way to calculate each side's average temperature would be to loop over the rows of the two arrays and calculate the temperatures.
